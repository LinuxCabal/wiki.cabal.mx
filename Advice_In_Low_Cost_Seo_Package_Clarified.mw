You can give your SEO efforts a boost by using off-site linking, but make sure these links lead to quality content from a reputable site. This is by far an extremely vital part of linking. Search engines value off-site links more than internal links to your own pages. Linking options that let you correspondingly link to yourself, like link exchanges, will also increase your rank.

To keep out of spam filters of search engines, do not use duplicated content on your sites. Watch out that you may be using content that is duplicated and not even know about it. Repeating the same thing over and over may be easier for you, but to SEO crawlers, it looks like spamming.

Rather than exchanging links, think about exchanging articles in your efforts to boost your rankings. This means you post another site owner's article with a link back to their website, and they do exactly the same for you. This type of SEO has more success than traditional link exchanges do.
