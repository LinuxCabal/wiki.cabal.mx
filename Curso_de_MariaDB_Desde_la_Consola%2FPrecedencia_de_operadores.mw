Functions precedence is always higher than operators precedence.

In this page CASE refers to the CASE operator, not to the 
CASE statement.

If the HIGH_NOT_PRECEDENCE SQL_MODE is set, 
NOT has the same precedence as !.

The || operator"'"s precedence, as well as its meaning, depends on 
the PIPES_AS_CONCAT SQL_MODE flag: if it is on, || can be used to 
concatenate strings (like the CONCAT() function) and has a higher 
precedence.

The = operator"'"s precedence depends on the context - it is higher 
when = is used as a comparison operator.

Parenthesis can be used to modify the operators precedence in an 
expression. 

Short-circuit evaluation

The AND, OR, && and || operators support short-circuit evaluation. 
This means that, in some cases, the expression on the right of those 
operators is not evaluated, because its result cannot affect the result. 
In the following cases, short-circuit evaluation is used and x() is not 
evaluated:

    FALSE AND x()
    FALSE && x()
    TRUE OR x()
    TRUE || x()
    NULL BETWEEN x() AND x() 

Note however that the short-circuit evaluation does not apply to NULL 
AND x(). Also, BETWEEN"'"s right operands are not evaluated if the left 
operand is NULL, but in all other cases all the operands are evaluated.

This is a speed optimization. Also, since functions can have side-effects, 
this behavior can be used to choose whether execute them or not using a 
concise syntax:

SELECT some_function() OR log_error();
