history [n]
       history -c

       history -anrw [filename]
       history -p arg [arg ...]
       history -s arg [arg ...]
              With no options, display the command history list with line num‐
              bers.  Lines listed with a * have been modified.  An argument of
              n lists only the last n lines.  If the shell variable  HISTTIME‐
              FORMAT  is  set  and not null, it is used as a format string for
              strftime(3) to display the time stamp associated with each  dis‐
              played  history  entry.  No intervening blank is printed between
              the formatted time stamp and the history line.  If  filename  is
              supplied,  it  is  used as the name of the history file; if not,
              the value of HISTFILE is used.  Options, if supplied,  have  the
              following meanings:
              -c     Clear the history list by deleting all the entries.
              -d offset
                     Delete the history entry at position offset.
              -a     Append  the  ``new'' history lines (history lines entered
                     since the beginning of the current bash session)  to  the
                     history file.
              -n     Read  the history lines not already read from the history
                     file into the current  history  list.   These  are  lines
                     appended  to  the history file since the beginning of the
                     current bash session.
              -r     Read the contents of the history file and use them as the
                     current history.
              -w     Write  the current history to the history file, overwrit‐
                     ing the history file's contents.
              -p     Perform history substitution on the  following  args  and
                     display  the  result  on  the  standard output.  Does not
                     store the results in the history list.  Each arg must  be
                     quoted to disable normal history expansion.
              -s     Store  the  args  in  the history list as a single entry.
                     The last command in the history list  is  removed  before
                     the args are added.

              If  the  HISTTIMEFORMAT variable is set, the time stamp informa‐
              tion associated with each history entry is written to  the  his‐
              tory  file, marked with the history comment character.  When the
              history file is read, lines beginning with the  history  comment
              character  followed  immediately  by  a digit are interpreted as
              timestamps for the previous history line.  The return value is 0
              unless  an  invalid option is encountered, an error occurs while
              reading or writing the history file, an invalid offset  is  sup‐
              plied as an argument to -d, or the history expansion supplied as
              an argument to -p fails.
