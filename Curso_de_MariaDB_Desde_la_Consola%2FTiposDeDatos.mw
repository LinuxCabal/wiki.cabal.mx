Numerico:
     
INT[(M)] [UNSIGNED] [ZEROFILL]
INTEGER[(M)] [UNSIGNED] [ZEROFILL]     2,147,483,648   a   2,147,483,647
                                                       o
                                             0   a   4,294,967,295
    (SIGNED es el default). 
    If a column has been set to ZEROFILL, all values will be prepended by zeros so that the INT value contains a number of M digits. 
    Note: If the ZEROFILL attribute has been specified, the column will automatically become UNSIGNED.


TINYINT[(M)] [UNSIGNED] [ZEROFILL]      -128   a   127
                                               o
                                           0       255
    If a column has been set to ZEROFILL, all values will be prepended by zeros so that the 
    TINYINT value contains a number of M digits.
    Note: If the ZEROFILL attribute has been specified, the column will automatically become UNSIGNED.


BOOLEAN          UnSigned Solemente             0        1    tinyint(1)
     
SMALLINT                             -32,768   a   32,767
                                               o
                                         0       65,535
    If a column has been set to ZEROFILL, all values will be prepended by zeros so that the 
    SMALLINT value contains a number of M digits.
    Note: If the ZEROFILL attribute has been specified, the column will automatically become UNSIGNED.


MEDIUMINT[(M)] [UNSIGNED] [ZEROFILL]     -8,388,608   a   8,388,607
                                                   o
                                             0   a   16,777,215
    If a column has been set to ZEROFILL, all values will be prepended by zeros to M digits.
    ZEROFILL pads the integer with zeroes and assumes UNSIGNED (even if UNSIGNED is not specified).


BIGINT[(M)] [UNSIGNED] [ZEROFILL]   -9,223,372,036,854,775,808   a   9,223,372,036,854,775,807 
                                                           o
                                               0   a   18,446,744,073,709,551,615
    If a column has been set to ZEROFILL, all values will be prepended by zeros to M digits.
    Note: If the ZEROFILL attribute has been specified, the column will automatically become UNSIGNED.
    SERIAL is an alias for:   BIGINT UNSIGNED NOT NULL AUTO_INCREMENT UNIQUE
                                                                                                                                                                   
FLOAT(M,D)      24      SIGNED Solemente      
     10,2
   small (single-precision) floating-point number (see DOUBLE for a regular-size floating point number). 
   Allowable values are:      -3.402823466E+38  a  -1.175494351E-38
                                                  o
                                1.175494351E-38  a  3.402823466E+38. 
    These are the theoretical limits, based on the IEEE standard. 
    The actual range might be slightly smaller depending on your hardware or operating system.
    M is the total number of digits and D is the number of digits following the decimal point. 
    If M and D are omitted, values are stored to the limits allowed by the hardware. 
    A single-precision floating-point number is accurate to approximately 7 decimal places.
    UNSIGNED, if specified, disallows negative values.
    Using FLOAT might give you some unexpected problems because all calculations in MariaDB are done with double precision. 
    See Floating Point Accuracy.


DOUBLE(M,D)     53      SIGNED Solemente      DOUBLE REAL === DOUBLE
      16,4
    A normal-size (double-precision) floating-point number (see FLOAT for a single-precision floating-point number).
    Allowable values are:          -1.7976931348623157E+308   a  -2.2250738585072014E-308
                                                          o
                                     2.2250738585072014E-308  a  1.7976931348623157E+308 
    These are the theoretical limits, based on the IEEE standard. 
    The actual range might be slightly smaller depending on your hardware or operating system.
    M is the total number of digits and D is the number of digits following the decimal point. 
    If M and D are omitted, values are stored to the limits allowed by the hardware. 
    A double-precision floating-point number is accurate to approximately 15 decimal places.
    UNSIGNED, if specified, disallows negative values.
    ZEROFILL, if specified, pads the number with zeros, up to the total number of digits specified by M.
    REAL and DOUBLE PRECISION are synonyms, unless the REAL_AS_FLOAT SQL mode is enabled,
    in which case REAL is a synonym for FLOAT rather than DOUBLE.
     

DECIMAL(M,D)    -       SIGNED Solemente      DECIMAL, NUMERIC, DEC, FIXED
        10,0
    A packed "exact" fixed-point number. M is the total number of digits (the precision) 
    and D is the number of digits after the decimal point (the scale). 
    The decimal point and (for negative numbers) the "-" sign are not counted in M. 
    If D is 0, values have no decimal point or fractional part 
    and on INSERT the value will be rounded to the nearest DECIMAL. 
    The maximum number of digits (M) for DECIMAL is 65. 
    The maximum number of supported decimals (D) is 30. 
    If D is omitted, the default is 0. 
    If M is omitted, the default is 10.


BIT[(M)]
    A bit-field type. M indicates the number of bits per value, from 1 to 64. 
    The default is 1 if M is omitted.
    Bit values can be inserted with b'value' notation, where value is the bit value in 0's and 1's.
    Bit fields are automatically zero-padded from the left to the full length of the bit, 
    so for example in a BIT(4) field, '10' is equivalent to '0010'.
    Bits are returned as binary, so to display them, either add 0, 
    or use a function such as HEX, OCT or BIN to convert them.

All basic calculations (+, -, *, /) with DECIMAL columns are done with a precision of 65 digits.
